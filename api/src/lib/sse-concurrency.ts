/**
 * Cap concurrent SSE streams per IP.
 *
 * The KV-backed `rateLimit` middleware in ratelimit.ts counts request
 * starts within a sliding window — perfectly fine for short JSON GETs
 * but useless for SSE: a malicious client can hold N streams open for
 * 60s+ each. While they're open, every stream's producer is doing
 * provider fan-out → upstream burn proportional to N, not to the
 * advertised 30/min cap.
 *
 * This guard tracks live stream count via a short-lived KV counter
 * keyed by IP. Increment on entry, decrement on stream end (best-effort
 * via ctx.waitUntil so we never block the close path). KV is eventually
 * consistent so this is a soft cap — fine for defensive use, not a
 * hard DDoS mitigation. For real hard caps, a Durable Object would be
 * the right tool; we deliberately stay on KV here to avoid the cost
 * and complexity bump.
 *
 * The counter has a short TTL (90s) so a Worker that crashes mid-stream
 * doesn't leave a phantom slot reserved.
