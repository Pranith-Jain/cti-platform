    `- Post 1 must stand alone: the single sharpest specific (a number, a contrast, a named target). It does NOT start with "1/" and is not a teaser — it delivers a real point even if nobody reads on.\n` +
    `- Middle posts: one concrete idea each — the detection angle, the attacker-economics read, the technical detail. Standalone-valuable.\n` +
    `- Last post: the analytical takeaway, then the link on its own line: ${postUrl}\n` +
    `- Append " (n/N)" at the END of each post (not the start). Each post < 270 chars incl. the counter.\n` +
    `- No hashtags. No emojis. No raw URLs except the single final link.\n` +

    `- Then the analysis: the pattern or contrast, the technical detail that matters (CVSS / CWE / exploit chain / affected versions / detection logic / victimology — only what the facts support, no padding).\n` +
    `- Formatting is mobile-first: very short paragraphs (1-3 lines), a blank line between almost every paragraph, generous white space. No walls of text. This matters as much as the words.\n` +

    `- Defensive takeaway must be specific to THIS threat model and non-obvious. Never the generic checklist. If the facts don't support concrete defense, say plainly what actually reduces exposure (the detection gap, the access vector, the recovery posture) in one or two sharp lines.\n` +
    `- Close with one substantive question that provokes a practitioner reply (not "what do you think?"), then the link on its own final line: ${postUrl}\n` +
    `- 1300-2000 characters. At most TWO lowercase hashtags, and only if genuinely relevant, placed on the final line after the link — never a stack, never mid-sentence. Prefer zero.\n` +

    `  "Lockbit5 dropped 15 new victims this week — but 4 of those targets already appeared on a different affiliate's leak site this quarter. The same haul is being re-auctioned. Affiliate dispute, not new compromise."\n` +

    `  "I've been thinking about ransomware affiliate movement lately. Here are some observations from the latest Lockbit5 activity."\n` +
