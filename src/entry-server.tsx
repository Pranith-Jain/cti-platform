/**
 * SSR entry point — Phase 3 streaming refactor (2026-05-12).
 *
 * Phase 1/2 used `renderToString` which doesn't await Suspense boundaries.
 * Every route under <Suspense fallback={...}><LazyRoute /></Suspense> in
 * App.tsx came out as the SectionLoader spinner instead of real content.
 * Only the Home route worked, because Home itself is eagerly imported.
 *
 * Switching to `renderToReadableStream` + `stream.allReady` makes React
 * actually walk through every Suspense boundary, await every lazy
 * import(), and emit the resolved content. The stream is then collected
 * into a string via Response(stream).text().
 *
 * Cost: render() is now async. The prerender script awaits each route.
 * The dynamic imports each lazy() makes also fire during Node SSR — Vite
 * emits each as a separate chunk in .ssr-build/assets/ and Node loads
 * them on demand. Total prerender time scales with route count.
