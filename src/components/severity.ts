/**
 * Canonical severity tones — used everywhere a CVE / detection / risk pill
 * is rendered. The five-step ramp (rose → orange → amber → slate → sky) maps
 * to threat-meaning, not a colour gradient — `low` is *intentionally* slate
 * (neutral), not green. A low-severity finding is still a finding, and green
 * reads as "safe/done" which conflicts with the severity meaning.
 *
 * Lives outside Badge.tsx so the component file can satisfy the
 * react-refresh/only-export-components rule (Fast Refresh needs files to
 * export components only). Same split pattern as tool-sections.ts.
